		<h3>This is my great mobile webpage</h3>
		<p>It has a lot of good content on it.</p>
		<p>It is optimized for mobile devices, so I only load 10 megabytes of ad tracker scripts and flash banners.</p>
		<p>I also built this JavaScript framework that kind of emulates the look and feel of native iOS apps, but on the web. It's only 10 times slower than a normal web page! Hopefully no one is using Android because then my faux-iOS look and feel will confuse them.</p>
		<p>All right, I really need to goto bed.</p>
