#### Let's encrypt all the things!

Introduction
------------
This is a widget to allow webmasters to embed an RTN banner on their site.
I will write a whole book about it when I have more time.


How to embed the script
-------------------------
```
<script src="//fightforthefuture.github.io/reset-the-net-widget/widget/rtn.js"></script>
```


How to test on different devices
--------------------
[**Please view this page, in each device & browser you'd like to QA.**][2] Note: Normally, the script will only appear once, per user, per device. On this page, we've disabled this "one-time" functionality, so you can check out the animations however many times you'd like.
