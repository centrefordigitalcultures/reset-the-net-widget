How to use the widget
-------------------------
Add this to any page, and you're golden:
```
<script src="//fightforthefuture.github.io/reset-the-net-widget/widget/rtn.js"></script>
```


How to QA the widget
--------------------
[**Please view this page, in each device & browser you'd like to QA.**][2]

Note: Normally, the script will only appear once, per user, per device. On this special page, we've disabled this "one-time" functionality, so you can check out the animations however many times you'd like.


Which browsers are supported
------------
Modern browsers, and the two latest versions of Internet Explorer.
