Introduction
------------
This is a widget to allow webmasters to embed an RTN banner on their site.
I will write a whole book about it when I have more time.


Installation instructions

Please see the demo pages above and do your best to reverse engineer them.
It's nearly 3am or I'd put something here.


Testing instructions

[**Please view this page, in each device & browser you'd like to QA.**][2]

Using the script on your website is easy. Just embed this HTML!
